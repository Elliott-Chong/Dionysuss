  "Where should I add documentation and comments in the codebase?":
    "Documentation and comments should be added throughout the codebase to provide clarity and understanding for other developers working on the project. Here are some guidelines on where to add documentation and comments:\n\n1. Overall Project Documentation: You can create a README.md file in the root directory of the project to provide an overview of the project, its purpose, and how to set it up and run it. This file can also include information about the project structure, dependencies, and any important configuration details.\n\n2. File-Level Documentation: Each file in the codebase should have a comment at the top explaining its purpose and any important information about the file. This can include a brief summary, author information, and modification history.\n\n3. Function/Method-Level Documentation: Before each function or method, you should add comments explaining its purpose, input parameters, return values, and any important implementation details. This helps other developers understand the functionality and usage of the function.\n\n4. Class/Component-Level Documentation: When defining a class or component, you should add comments describing its purpose, responsibilities, and any important details about its usage. This helps other developers understand the role and functionality of the class or component.\n\n5. Inline Comments: Throughout the code, you can add inline comments to explain complex or non-obvious code logic. Inline comments should be used sparingly and only when necessary to provide clarity.\n\nRemember to write clear and concise comments that are helpful to others who may be reading the code. Good documentation and comments can greatly improve the maintainability and understanding of a codebase.",
